	Case Study: The Therac-25 Accidents<br><br>
		The Therac-25 case, detailed by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), presents a seminal example in the ethics of software engineering.
		Between 1985 and 1987, a series of accidents involving the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine resulted in severe injuries and deaths due to 
		massive radiation overdoses. The root cause was a software error—one that had not been thoroughly tested nor independently verified. This
		tragedy highlights the crucial need for ethical diligence, rigorous quality assurance, and transparent accountability in computing.<br><br>
		The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct includes principles highly relevant to this case, particularly:<br>
			*       1.2: Avoid harm,<br>

			*       2.5: Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks, and<br>

			*       3.10: Ensure that systems are safe and secure (ACM, 2018).<br><br>

			The software engineers and the company responsible for the Therac-25 did not uphold these standards. They dismissed reported malfunctions and 
			failed to apply proper testing protocols, reflecting poor professional judgment and a neglect of public safety.Legally, while no criminal charges were 
			filed, the case raised questions about liability and the regulation of medical software. Jurisdictionally, it illustrated a gap in U.S. regulatory oversight
			 for software embedded in medical devices, prompting changes in how the FDA now evaluates such technologies (Leveson & Turner, 1993). Socially, it 
			 eroded public trust in medical technology and professional integrity.In comparison, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct similarly 
			 emphasizes responsibilities like public interest (Section 1) and professional competence and integrity (Section 2) (BCS, 2015). Both ACM and BCS 
			 place safeguarding human welfare at the forefront, and both codes would have mandated proactive risk assessment, stakeholder communication, and error 
			 rectification—elements absent in the Therac-25 case.The Therac-25 tragedy underscores the ethical imperative in computing to prioritize human life and 
			 dignity over product delivery or corporate interest. It is a cornerstone case that continues to influence how ethical practice is embedded in software 
			 engineering curricula and professional standards.<br><br>

	<b>Peer Response</b><br><br>
	Peer Response to Sultan Alaryani<br>
Your post offers a well-balanced analysis of the Malware Disruption case. I agree with your observation that Rogue Services violated critical ethical principles such as avoiding harm and considering the public good. Hosting malicious content and ignoring formal requests to intervene reflect blatant disregard for both the ACM (2018) and BCS (2015) codes. What’s particularly compelling is how you highlighted the ethical dilemma faced by those who developed the worm—acting to protect the public but also breaching legal norms.
However, I wonder if the developers' actions could have been more ethically justified if they had worked through proper international regulatory bodies or law enforcement. Do you think a lack of global cybersecurity governance frameworks pressures professionals to take such vigilante approaches?

<br><br>Peer Response to Mauricio Lozano<br>
Your post presents a nuanced take on unauthorized malware intervention, especially the tension between moral intent and professional boundaries. The reference to Principle 2.5 of the ACM Code is especially relevant—thorough risk evaluation is critical. While I understand your concern about the potential for unintended harm, I also feel this case reveals a gap in timely, coordinated international responses to cyber threats.
You rightly caution against undermining public trust through unilateral action. Perhaps what’s missing in these cases is a structured emergency protocol for ethical hacking under legal supervision. Could an international ethical cybersecurity task force be a solution to prevent future lone interventions?

<br><br>Peer Response to Koulthoum Hassan Ahmad Flamerzi<br>
Your analysis of the "Inadvertent Disclosure of Sensitive Data" case is both insightful and grounded in key ethical frameworks. You clearly connect the engineer’s oversight to violations of ACM Code Principles 1.6 and 2.5, highlighting the responsibility to respect privacy and evaluate risks thoroughly (ACM, 2018). I also appreciate how you tied this to the legal consequences under GDPR and the UK’s Data Protection Act—demonstrating how ethical lapses often lead to legal repercussions.
What stands out in your post is the link to the BCS Code of Conduct, particularly around public interest and professional competence. This dual-code comparison strengthens your argument that ethical awareness must be embedded at all stages of software development.
That said, I wonder if the responsibility lies solely with the individual engineer. Could this failure also reflect systemic issues, like organizational culture or lack of proper testing protocols? In such cases, shouldn't ethical responsibility be shared across teams and management, not just placed on the developer?
Your post makes a strong case for embedding ethical foresight into software practices, and I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on how companies can create more ethically resilient development environments.

<b>Summary Post</b><br><br>
The Therac-25 case remains a defining example of ethical failure in software engineering, serving as a cautionary tale for computing professionals. My initial post explored the ethical lapses through the lens of the ACM and BCS codes of conduct, identifying breaches in responsibilities like avoiding harm (ACM 1.2), conducting thorough evaluations (ACM 2.5), and ensuring safety (ACM 3.10). The feedback from peers significantly deepened my understanding of the broader implications and helped me identify areas of improvement in my original argument.
Jaafar El Komati emphasized how early warnings were dismissed by engineers and management, highlighting not just technical flaws but systemic ethical negligence. His focus on the need for ongoing scrutiny—even when systems have proven reliable—challenged my initial framing of the issue as purely technical. Sultan Alaryani’s suggestion to consider ACM Principle 1.1, “Contribute to society and to human well-being,” further enhanced my view. While my post focused on avoiding harm, Sultan rightly pointed out that ethical conduct also requires proactive enhancement of user safety and societal benefit.
Both reviews highlighted the lack of internal communication and organizational responsibility, a point I had underexplored. This reinforces the idea that ethics in computing extends beyond code quality to include effective team collaboration and corporate accountability. The tragedy of Therac-25 wasn't simply a technical error; it was a failure to uphold professional integrity, communication, and social responsibility.
Reflecting on Units 1 to 3, this discussion has helped me grow in appreciating how ethical principles must be consistently applied from design to deployment, and how lapses can lead to systemic failures. The case underlines the importance of embedding ethics in both individual practice and organizational culture, demonstrating how ethical foresight can prevent real-world harm and strengthen public trust in technology.
