  <br><b>Reflective Report on Statistical Knowledge and Data Analysis Skills</b><br><br><br>
  <b>WHAT (What happened?)</b><br><br>
  During my time in the Numerical Analysis module at the University of Essex, I experienced a steep yet rewarding learning curve in statistical thinking, problem-solving, and the practical application of tools like R for data analysis. Entering this course, I had a general understanding of statistics but limited exposure to programming, especially with a language as syntax-heavy and precise as R. Throughout the module, I was tasked with conducting numerical investigations, exploring real datasets, and reflecting on my learning journey.
The coursework focused on mastering statistical fundamentals—hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and data visualization—while simultaneously developing digital literacy and numeracy skills. I worked on various artefacts such as summary tables, contingency tables, and plots generated using R. Additionally, I engaged in peer review, weekly formative tasks, and feedback sessions with tutors to improve my approach and refine the accuracy of my work.
One task that stood out involved exploring the relationship between age and income level using linear regression in R. This required importing a dataset, checking for missing values, generating exploratory plots, and performing inferential analysis using p-values and confidence intervals. The experience not only honed my statistical interpretation but also pushed me to engage critically with my outputs and the assumptions behind them.
Alongside technical learning, we also developed a Professional Development Plan (PDP) and filled in a Skills Matrix, tracking our progress across academic, digital, and interpersonal competencies. These tools helped me stay focused, set actionable goals, and assess how I was applying theory into practice over the course of the module.

<br><br><b>SO WHAT (What did it mean?)</b><br><br>
Reflecting on the experience, I have made substantial strides in my confidence using R and understanding its place in numerical and statistical analysis. In the beginning, I often struggled with even basic syntax errors, and the error messages were overwhelming. However, through consistent practice, discussion forums, and support from tutors, I gradually gained confidence. I can now independently conduct data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and statistical testing using R, which is a milestone I’m genuinely proud of.
The greatest conceptual breakthrough came when I began to truly understand p-values and confidence intervals—not just how to calculate them, but what they mean in context. For instance, understanding that a p-value under 0.05 doesn’t “prove” anything, but instead indicates the likelihood of the observed data assuming the null hypothesis is true, helped me critically engage with statistical significance. Similarly, learning how confidence intervals reflect both the reliability and precision of our estimates added a deeper dimension to how I interpret results. This awareness has made me more cautious and ethical in my analysis and less likely to jump to conclusions based solely on threshold values.
Creating and interpreting summary tables and contingency tables in R was initially challenging. I recall struggling with getting table() and prop.table() functions to display results in a way that matched my expectations. However, through experimentation and review of examples in class materials and online documentation, I eventually got the hang of it. These outputs proved invaluable in quickly identifying patterns in the data, such as proportions and cross-tabulated frequencies that supported more complex analysis.
When it came to plotting data, the power of R’s ggplot2 package became increasingly apparent. In one of my formative tasks, I created a histogram of residuals from a regression model and, after tutor feedback, refined it with better labels, consistent scales, and clear titles. These small changes drastically improved the readability of my plots and enhanced my communication skills—a vital asset in presenting results to an audience unfamiliar with statistical jargon.
From an emotional standpoint, the module brought moments of frustration—particularly when code wouldn’t run or results didn’t make intuitive sense—but also strong feelings of achievement. These emotional swings forced me to develop resilience and adopt a growth mindset, realizing that making mistakes was an essential part of the learning process.
The feedback I received from both tutors and peers played a crucial role in improving my work. One peer noted that my initial summary lacked clear explanations for the statistical tests I used, prompting me to include rationale and context in future submissions. My tutor also advised me to annotate my R scripts more clearly and consistently, which I’ve since implemented. This feedback loop was invaluable and taught me the importance of collaboration and reflection.

<br><br><b>NOW WHAT (What will I do next?)</b><br><br>
This module has not only given me practical experience with statistical tools, but also equipped me with transferable skills that I can now apply in academic, research, and workplace settings. I’ve begun building a portfolio of R-based projects, showcasing analyses with clear narratives, visualizations, and interpretations. This will be an asset in both postgraduate studies and employment in data-related fields.
Moving forward, I’ve outlined a series of goals in my updated Professional Development Plan:
•	Continue practicing with R through datasets on platforms like Kaggle and TidyTuesday.
•	Explore more advanced topics in R such as clustering, principal component analysis, and time-series forecasting.
•	Strengthen my academic writing by integrating more external sources and properly citing them when discussing statistical approaches.
•	Maintain a reflective journal for future modules to help track emotional and intellectual growth, not just outcomes.
This module has also supported my development across a broad range of professional skills, including:
•	Time Management: I had to juggle weekly readings, practice exercises, and reflections, which taught me how to prioritize tasks effectively.
•	Critical Thinking and Analysis: Each dataset presented unique challenges and required contextual understanding and evaluation of results.
•	Communication and Literacy: Translating technical findings into clear, concise summaries helped me develop a skill crucial for any analyst.
•	IT and Digital Skills: I can now use RStudio confidently, navigate packages and repositories, and debug basic errors in code.
•	Numeracy: I am more comfortable working with statistical notation, interpreting outputs, and using numerical methods to draw conclusions.
•	Research and Ethical Awareness: I became more aware of the responsibility that comes with data analysis—how results are framed and the potential impact of misinterpretation.
The module has encouraged me to embrace uncertainty, ask more questions, and appreciate the balance between automation and interpretation. I now understand that statistical software is only a tool—it is our understanding of the data and our ethical responsibility that give it meaning.

<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
Reflecting on the Numerical Analysis module, I can confidently say that it has been a defining part of my academic development at the University of Essex. I entered with limited knowledge of R and left with not just proficiency, but a genuine interest in data science and statistical analysis. I have acquired technical skills, improved my communication and critical thinking, and gained new confidence in handling complex analytical tasks. Most importantly, I have developed a reflective habit that I will carry forward, ensuring that each learning experience informs the next.
