  <br><br><b>Reflective Report – Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</b><br><br>
  
  <b>WHAT – Description of Learning Experience</b><br>
  The Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) module at the University of Essex offered me a structured deep dive into the core principles that enable machines to 
  represent, reason with, and utilize knowledge effectively. This course presented theoretical foundations and practical implementations of knowledge-based systems, guiding
  me through formal logic systems, ontology development, rule-based reasoning, and description logics.
  At the start, the concept of "representing knowledge" seemed abstract. However, weekly lectures and lab sessions clarified how foundational formalisms like First Order 
  Logic (FOL), Semantic Networks, and Description Logics (DL) serve as the scaffolding for intelligent systems. One key project that shaped my learning was designing a 
  knowledge base using OWL (Web Ontology Language) and applying reasoning tools like Protégé and HermiT to infer new facts from existing ones.
  Our collaborative activities also played a major role. I contributed to peer discussions on case studies like intelligent agents in healthcare, where we debated the 
  strengths and weaknesses of different representation techniques. Engaging with feedback from both peers and tutors enabled me to sharpen my analytical lens and better 
  appreciate the limitations of each approach.<br><br>
  
  <b>SO WHAT – Analysis and Interpretation</b><br>
  This module challenged and reshaped my understanding of knowledge systems in several ways. Initially, I approached the subject with a programmer’s mindset, 
  focusing on implementation over theory. But as I progressed, I recognized how essential formal semantics are in ensuring system reliability and consistency. 
  The formal approaches—though sometimes difficult—offered a level of precision that natural language or ad-hoc programming could not provide.
  One emotional response that stood out was frustration during the modeling of a domain ontology for a smart city scenario. The OWL syntax and reasoning inconsistencies 
  caused several setbacks. However, this pushed me to read additional literature and consult with classmates, and ultimately deepened my grasp of open vs. closed world 
  assumptions and the subtleties of class hierarchies in DL.
  I also found it insightful to reflect on peer and tutor feedback. A tutor once commented that my knowledge base “was logically sound but lacked depth in domain 
  specificity.” This helped me understand that representation is not just about correctness, but about capturing real-world nuance. I applied this insight in later 
  tasks by enhancing the expressiveness of my ontologies using property restrictions and axioms.
  Critically, I noticed a shift in how I engage with complex systems: I now look for ways to deconstruct problems using formal methods, a skill I had not developed before 
  this module.<br><br>
  
  <b>NOW WHAT – Application and Professional Growth</b><br>
  The knowledge and skills developed in this module have significant long-term implications. In professional settings—especially in AI and data-intensive fields—the 
  ability to model domains formally and reason about knowledge is invaluable. For instance, I’ve already begun applying semantic modeling to a personal side project involving 
  a recommender system, where I now explore how ontologies can improve content tagging and user profiling.<br><br>
  From a skill development perspective, I gained competence across multiple dimensions:<br>
•	Time Management: Planning out the stages of building a complex knowledge base required iterative testing and refinement. I learned to balance research, coding, and documentation effectively.
<br>•	Critical Thinking and Analysis: I had to continuously assess which representation technique suited which domain. For example, while Semantic Networks were intuitive, DL offered greater formal rigor.
<br>•	Communication and Literacy: Explaining abstract concepts like logical entailment and rule chaining in our group activities helped refine my ability to express technical ideas clearly.
<br>•	Digital Skills: Using Protégé, reasoners like HermiT, and XML-based representations improved my digital fluency.
<br>•	Ethical Awareness: We explored bias in AI systems and the ethical implications of incomplete or misleading knowledge bases. This has made me more conscious of representation bias.

<br><br>I also documented my learning using a Professional Development Plan (PDP). In it, I set three core goals: 1) Master ontology development, 2) Improve peer feedback interpretation, and 3) Apply KRR to a real-world dataset. I believe I’ve made significant strides on all fronts.
Artefacts and Collaborative Evidence<br><br>

Throughout the module, I produced and contributed to several artefacts:<br>
•	A comprehensive OWL-based ontology representing a smart healthcare domain.
<br>•	A decision tree model created during a lab session to explore non-monotonic reasoning.
<br>•	Participation in discussion forums where I initiated a debate on the utility of FOL vs DL in dynamic environments.
<br>•	Screenshots and logs from my Protégé sessions (attached) demonstrate how I iteratively debugged inconsistencies in class hierarchies.
<br>•	Peer-reviewed short tasks where we critiqued each other's rule-based systems, providing annotated feedback.

<br><br>These artefacts align with module learning outcomes—especially those concerning the critical appraisal of modelling techniques and the development of knowledge-based systems.

<br><br><b>Conclusion and Final Reflection</b><br>
Reflecting on this journey, I am struck by how the theoretical frameworks we studied are so deeply woven into real-world AI systems. This module has made me more 
analytical, more precise in my thinking, and more reflective in my approach to problem-solving. I now recognize that knowledge representation is not simply about logic 
and structure—it’s about bridging the gap between human understanding and machine processing in the most faithful way possible.
Looking forward, I aim to deepen my skills in ontological engineering, possibly pursuing certifications or contributing to open-source KRR projects. I also intend to 
explore hybrid systems that blend symbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning, an area I was introduced to during this module.
This module has laid a strong intellectual foundation for my future in AI and intelligent systems design, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn through both 
individual exploration and collaborative engagement.<br><br>
